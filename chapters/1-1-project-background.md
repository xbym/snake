# 1.1 Project Background

Traditional Snake AI implementations typically face several key challenges that limit their potential and real-world applications. This section explores these challenges and introduces our innovative solutions.

## Traditional Challenges

### 1. Limited Decision Making
Traditional Snake AI implementations often rely on simple rule-based systems or basic pathfinding algorithms. These approaches lack the adaptability needed for complex environments and fail to demonstrate true learning capabilities.

### 2. Isolated Behavior
Most existing implementations operate in isolation, without any connection to external data or events. This limits their practical applications and makes them less engaging for real-world scenarios.

### 3. Static Learning
Traditional systems often use fixed strategies that don't evolve over time, missing opportunities for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing conditions.

## Our Solutions

### 1. Neural Network Decision System
We implement a sophisticated neural network architecture that provides:
- Multi-layer perception capabilities
- Real-time environmental analysis
- Dynamic decision-making processes
- Continuous learning and adaptation

### 2. Blockchain Integration
Our system uniquely incorporates blockchain technology:
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Movement triggers based on blockchain activity
- Intelligent queue management for smooth operation
- Direct connection to real-world events

### 3. Evolutionary Learning
We've developed an advanced learning system that:
- Preserves successful behaviors
- Adapts to changing conditions
- Maintains learning progress through deaths
- Optimizes decision-making over time

## Innovation Focus
Our project addresses these challenges through a combination of:
1. Advanced AI techniques
2. Real-world data integration
3. Continuous learning mechanisms
4. Interactive visualization tools

This innovative approach not only solves traditional limitations but also creates new possibilities for AI-blockchain integration in gaming and beyond.
