## 1. Introduction

Neural Snake AI is an innovative project that combines the classic Snake game with neural networks and blockchain technology, creating an autonomous learning system. The project not only demonstrates the learning capabilities of artificial intelligence but also creates a unique interaction model where system behavior is driven by blockchain transaction data.

In this system, the AI-controlled snake not only learns and evolves autonomously but also has each of its movements directly linked to real-time transaction activities on the blockchain. This innovative combination not only showcases blockchain data visualization but also provides a novel behavioral driving mechanism for AI systems.
